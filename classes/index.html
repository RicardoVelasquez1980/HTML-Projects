                Classes are made in the styling sheet and can then be an attribute to <b>ANY</b> element.

             Classes can be reused on as many elements whether the same element or not.

            <h1>More On Classes</h1>

            <p>
                Multiple classes can also be on a single element. In order to add more classes to an element just separate the class
                names by a <i>space</i>.

            </p>

         </div>

         <p class = "doubleClass basics">
            The styling is still the same here even though the ordering of the class names are different.
            This is because it is the ordering of the Class
            <br>

            within the styling sheet that decides which is applied first.
