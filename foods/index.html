            Foods typically rich in nutrition and have helpful benefits to them are considered healthy foods.
            These can range from organic food to <abbr title = "Genetically Modified Organism">GMO</abbr> food.
            <br>

            Foods with low nutrition and high sugar, fat, and calories are considered unhealthy foods.
            These can range from fast-food to snacks.

            Consumption of healthy foods gives you plenty of energy so you can do all the tasks for the day.
            However, plenty of energy isn't the only great thing about healthy food.
            <br>

            It also leads to a improved mental health, gut health, and heart health.
            We also can't forget that healthy foods make you less prone to cardiovascular diseases.
            <br>

            So if healthy foods have such amazing benefits why doesn't anyone just eat healthy?
            Healthy food is more expensive than unhealthy food, so a majority of the lower class tend to eat unhealthy.
            <br>

            In addition to the higher cost of healthy foods, most people don't find it tasteful enough.

        <p style = "font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(132, 90, 65);">
            Consumption of unhealthy foods releases endorphins so consumers temporarily recieve feelings of euphoria.
            Unhealthy food is also everywhere and affordable for anyone, this makes it the go to when hungry.
            <br>
            
            However, just because the food is tasty and makes you feel good, it doesn't mean it is good for you.
            Unhealthy food gives you very little energy so you may end up not doing all which you plan on doing for the day.
            <br>

            Low energy for the day isnt the only thing that comes from eating unhealthy.
            Obesity, heart and cardiovasular diseases, lack of focus are all negative outcomes of unhealthy foods.

            From May 19, 2022 to May 27, 2022 high school student Maia asked her instagram followers to fill out a survey
            of what they had(plan to have) for dinner. Over all the participants of the survey,
            <br>

            whether the food these teens ate for dinner was healthy or unhealthy, the results were split quite evenly.
            Those who went out to eat, typically for pizza, ate unhealthy whereas those
            <br>

            who ate homemade meals, are healthy. So this brings up a question, are homemade meals always healthier?
            The simple answer is no. This is because some of the participants would eat beans with dessert, and beans on their own
            <br>

            does not provide all the necessary nutrition humans need. Just as not all homemade meals are healthy
            not all food from resturants unhealthy.
            <br>

            One of the participants went to a town restuarnt and had the following: 

            <q>
            cheesy garlic bread, vegetarian sushi roll
            <abbr title = "with">w/</abbr>Asparagus, avocado, daikon radish, cucumber, julienne carrot, topped with
            <br>

            tempura crisps, Unagi sorry glaze, dynamite a√Øoli and wasabi Ponzi sauce, Sea weed salad

            </q>.

            Now I don't know about you but that sounds delicious and it is also healthy!
