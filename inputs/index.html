        <h1>Input Basics</h1>

        <h2>Button</h2>
        <p>
            Just a simple button, straight forward to understand.
            
        </p>
        <input type="button" value="Click Me!" onclick="alert('You just clicked a button.')">
        
        <h2>Checkbox</h2>
        <p>
            Zero or more options may be selected.
            
        </p>
        <input type="checkbox">

        <h2>Color</h2>
        <p>
            The way the color picker looks depends on the browser.

        </p>
        <!-- Tried Using rgb() To Specify The Color Value But It Doesnt Seem To Work -->
        <input type="color" value="#0000ff">

        <h2>Date</h2>
        <p>
           The way the date looks depends on the browser.<br>
           Also when specifying a min/max date make sure to use the following format, <i>YYYY/MM/DD</i>

        </p>
        <input type="date" min="2000-01-01" max="2026-01-01">

        <h2>Datetime-Local</h2>
        <p>
            The way the datetime-local looks depends on the browser.<br>
            Just like the <i>date</i> type but it also contains a time, and the time doesnt have a specified time zone.

        </p>
        <input type="datetime-local">

        <h2>Email</h2>
        <p>
            The way the email looks depends on the browser.<br>
            Some Mobile devices recognize the email type and add the <i>.com</i> to the keyboard.

        </p>
        <input type="email">

        <h2>File</h2>
        <p>
            Literally behaves like all file inputs which you have used throughout your life.

        </p>
        <input type="file">
        
        <h2>Hidden</h2>
        <p>
            This input, as you can guess, is hidden from the user and cant be changed.<br>
            Although it can be seen if users use Dev Tools or View Source, so its best not to use as a form of security.<br>
            This is used when you want to store some data which will be included with the rest of the form without worrying about
            it being altered, an example can be a form id.

        </p>
        <input type="hidden">

        <h2>Image</h2>
        <p>
            Same functionality as the "submit" type but the difference is that it is used to replace the submit button
            with an image.

        </p>
        <input type="image">

        <h2>Month</h2>
        <p>
            The way the month looks depends on the browser.

        </p>
        <input type="month">

        <h2>Number</h2>
        <p>
            Allows for the input of a number.<br>
            You can set restrictions.

        </p>
        <input type="number" min="1" max="4">

        <h2>Password</h2>
        <p>
            The characters in a password field are masked as asterisks or circles.

        </p>
        <input type="password">

        <h2>Radio</h2>
        <p>
            Only one of the many options can be selected.<br>
            Remember to give all related options the same name else the user can select multiple.

        </p>
        <input type="radio">

        <h2>Range</h2>
        <p>
            By default the range is 0 to 100.

        </p>
        <input type="range" min="50" max="1980">

        <h2>Reset</h2>
        <p>
            Easy to guess what this does.<br>
            Has to be in a form though for it to work and it will only work for the form elements in the same form.

        </p>
        <input type="reset">

        <h2>Search</h2>
        <p>
            Behaves like the "text" type but its used for search fields. I dont know, search it up. Pun unintended.

        </p>
        <input type="search">

        <h2>Submit</h2>
        <p>
            Submits the form to the form handler which is covered in the <a href="../forms/index.html">Form Lesson</a>.

        </p>
        <input type="submit">

        <h2>Tel</h2>
        <p>
            For telephone number inputs.

        </p>
        <input type="tel">

        <h2>Text</h2>
        <p>
            Single line text input.<br>
            This is the default input type if non are specified.

        </p>
        <input type="text">

        <h2>Time</h2>
        <p>
            The way the time looks depends on the browser.<br>
            Time zone isnt specified.

        </p>
        <input type="time">

        <h2>URL</h2>
        <p>
            URL field may be automatically validated when submitted, depends on the browser.<br>
            On Mobile devices the keyboard adds <i>.com</i> when it recognizes the url type.

        </p>
        <input type="url">

        <h2>Week</h2>
        <p>
            The way week looks depends on the browser.

        </p>
        <input type="week">

    </body>
