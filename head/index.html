        <h1>Intro</h1>

        <p>
            The Head is an element which contains
            <span title = "Data About Data" style = "font-style: italic">metadata</span>.
            Metadata usually defines the document title, character set, styles, script, and more. It also isnt displayed.

        </p>

        <h1>Title</h1>

        <p>
            The <i>title</i> is the title of the document and is shown in the browsers title bar, the name on the pages tab.
            The <i>title</i> is required since it is used for
            <span title = "Search Engine Optimization">SEO</span>
            and to allow search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search result.
            <br>

        </p>

        <h1>Style</h1>

        <p>
            Just the styling for the single HTML document.

        </p>
        
        <h1>Link</h1>

        <p>
            The <i>link</i> element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.
            <br>

            <i>Link</i> is mainly used to reference external style sheets or add an icon next to the page title.

        </p>

        <h1>Meta</h1>

        <p>
            The <i>meta</i> element is usually used to specify the character set, page description, keywords,
            author of the document, and viewport settings.
            <br>

            <i>Meta</i> isnt displayed but it is used by the browsers to know how to display content or reload the page,
            by search engines to get the keywords, and by other web services.

        </p>

        <h1>Scripts</h1>

        <p>
            Scripts can be in the <i>head</i> element but it is best to put them just before closing the body.
            This way when loading a script it wont delay loadin the HTML.
            <br>

            Also if the script were to not load then the everything under it wont load.

        </p>

        <h1>Base</h1>

        <p>
            The <i>base</i> element specifies the base URL for all relative URLs in the page. 
            <br>

            So if you were to do <q>images/face.png</q>, it will become <q>baseURL/images/face.png</q>
            <br>

            There can also only be one base element in the entire document.
            Look at the code to see how to make a base URL.
