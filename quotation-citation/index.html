            Latdict was created to be a Latin resource website, provided free of charge, to the online community. Well, to be
            completely honest, Latdict was originally an experiment that eventually developed into a fully-fledged website. It all
            started as a hobbyist activity, playing around with another type of language â€” a computer language called PHP. I found a
            neat new framework to play around with, and I wanted to learn it by creating a practical project that would give me some
            focus. Thus, Latdict was born out of my own tinkering.
