        <h1>Colors</h1>
        
        <p>
            By Default when a link isnt clicked, aka unvisited, it is blue and underlined.
            <br>

            When it is clicked, aka visited, it is purple and underlined.
            <br>

            And when its currently being clicked, aka active, it is red and underlined.
            <br>

            However, these can be changed, and you can make spectacular things with it such as buttons.

        <h1>Bookmarks</h1>
        
        <p>
            <!-- "href" Is Linking To An "id" Which Is Made Further Down -->
            <!-- Calling/Linking To An "id" Like This Is Called A Bookmak And A "#" Must Always Be Before The "id" Name -->
            <!-- In Order To Link To An "id" On Another Page First Indicate The File Location Followed By The "id" Name -->
            <!-- EX: "<a href = "example.index#idName">Bookmark On Another Page</a>"-->
            This <a href = "#BLoc">bookmark</a> will take you to a location on the site farther down.
            <br>

            Bookmarks are useful for long webpages.
