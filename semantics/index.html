        <h1>Semantic Meaning</h1>

        <p>
            As brefily mention in <i>computercode</i>,
            semantics are elements which provide meaning.
            <br>

            The following are semantics which are used to define parts of a site.

        </p>

        <section>
            <h1>Sections</h1>

            <p>
                Sections are used to, well, define a section.
                A section typically contains a group of content, usually with a heading.
                <br>
                 
                Examples of this are the following:

            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Chapters</li>
                <li>Intros</li>
                <li>Contact Info</li>

            </ul>

        </section>

        <!-- Both The Section And Article Elements Can Be Nested Wihtin One Another -->

        <!-- Articles Should Make Sense On There Own And Should Be Able TO Be Distributed Independently From All Else -->
        <article>
            <h1>Article</h1>

            <p>
                The <i>Article Element</i> is used to speficy self contained content such as a forum post,
                blog post, comments, product cards, etc.

            </p>

        </article>

        <header>
            <h1>Header</h1>

            <p>What is a Header?</p>

        </header>

        <p>
            A Header typically contains heading(s), icons/logos, authorship info, and more.
            <br>

            Although you can have multiple header elements in a site, headers cant be nested in a <i>footer</i>,
            <i>address</i>, or another <i>header</i> element.

        </p>

        <h1>Footer</h1>

        <p>
            The footer typically contains authorship info, copyright info, 
            contact info, sitemap, back to top links, and similar sites.

        </p>

        <footer>
            <p>Author: Ricardo Velasquez</p>

        </footer>

        <!-- Note: Not All Links Should Be In The Nav Element, Use Only When There Is A Large List Of Nav Links -->
        <h1>Nav</h1>

        <p>
            Although I dont show an example of this, <i>nav</i> is used when creating a navigation bar, in most cases.
            <br>

            A Nav Bar is a list of links which take the user to another related site or to a bookmarked section in the site itself.

        </p>

        <!-- Aside Can Be Used To Give A Brief Definition/Explanation Of A Term As Exampled Below -->
        <!-- The content in the aside element should be indirectly related to the surrounding content -->
        <h1>Aside</h1>

        <p>I enjoy mangos.</p>

        <aside>
            <p>
                A mango is a tropical fruit.

            </p>

        </aside>

        <h1>figure & figcaption</h1>

        <!-- Figure Specifies Self Contianed Content Such As Illustrations, Diagrams, Code Listings, And More -->
        <!-- FigCaption Provides A Caption For The Figure And It Can Be Placed Before Or After The Figure Itself -->
        <figure>
            <figcaption>Image of me</figcaption>

            <img src = "IMG.jpg" alt = "Me" style = "width: 15%; height: 15%">

            <figcaption>Image Of Me</figcaption>

        </figure>

    </body>
