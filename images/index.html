        <h1>Image Maps</h1>

        <p>
            Image Maps allow you to click on certian parts of an image which will direct you to a new link.

            The chin, left(your left) ear, and nose are examples of this.

        <h1>
            Background Images

        </h1>

        <p>
            I have added a background image to the entire <i>body</i>.
            <br>

            A background image will continue to repeat itself until its covers the entire elements, clearly you can prevent this with the following in the <i>style</i> element:
            <br>

            <i>background-repeat: no-repeat</i>

        </p>

        <h1>Picture Element</h1>

        <p>
            The <i>picture</i> element allows you to display multiple images depending on the screen size.
            <br>

            Resize the page and refresh to see what I mean.
            <br>

            Not going to lie, as of the day I made this, I am confused on the <i>picture</i> element.

        </p>

        <pre>
            When to use the Picture Element
            There are two main purposes for the <picture> element:
            
                1. Bandwidth
                If you have a small screen or device, it is not necessary to load a large image file. The browser will use the first
                <source> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any of the following elements.
            
                2. Format Support
                Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats. By using the <picture> element, you can add images of
                    all formats, and the browser will use the first format it recognizes, and ignore any of the following elements.

        </pre>

        <picture>
            <source media = "(min-width: 800px)" srcset = "IMG.jpg">
            <source media = "(min-width: 650px)" srcset="https://www.w3schools.com/html/picture_example.jpg">
            <source media = "(min-width: 465px)" srcset="https://www.w3schools.com/images/mypagelogo32x32.png">

            <img src = "IMG.jpg" alt = "Me">

        </picture>
