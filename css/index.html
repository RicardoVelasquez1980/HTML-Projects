        <p>
            This is what you have been doing so far to implement CSS.
            <br>

            It is the <q>style = </q> attribute.
            <br>

            It is usually used to apply a unique styling to an HTMl element.

        </p>

        <hr>

        <h1>Internal</h1>

        <p>
            This is where you decide the styling within the HTML but rather than adding it in each element you
            <br>

            write it in the <q>head</q> element. 
            <br>

            This styling will apply for <b>ALL</b> HTML elements unless you overwrite them using the <i>inline</i> method.

        </p>

        <hr>

        <h1>External</h1>

        <p>
            This involves a seperate <q>style.css</q> file which decides the styling for the entire site.
            <br>

            This file is called within the HTML <q>head</q> element as follows:
            <br>

            <q>< link rel = "stylesheet" href = "style.css" ></q>

        </p>

    </body>
